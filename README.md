# Deep-Learning-for-handwriting-recognition
A simple project to implement a neural network to recognize hand written digits from the MNIST library

The inputs are 28*28 images of handwritten digits from the mnist library.
The neural network consists of 2 hidden layers.
Activation functions of relu and softmax are used for hidden layers and output layers respectively.

An accuracy of 97% was obtained.

On running the program, we can see that the output being predicted is the number 7.
